# wordpressripper
I thought I was going to migrate a Wordpress blog (http://www.geekytattoos.com)
to Tumblr, so I wrote something to quickly pull down my posts including
downloading the images. I ended up migrating to Wordpress.com, but thought
this might be useful to someone. If nothing else it's a nice way to archive
a Wordpress site using the XMLRPC.

Requires:
- wordpress_xmlrpc
- bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4)
